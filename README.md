### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

I am a research scientist with wide range of skills in field, laboratory, and computational biology.

Currently, I am a postdoc in Dr. Malak Tfailyâ€™s ecosystem genomics lab at University of Arizona, Tucson. I am responsible for designing and developing metabolomics and other omics data analysis pipelines. I also train and mentor undegraduate and graduate students in laboratory safety, and research.

I use these technologies and tools daily:
